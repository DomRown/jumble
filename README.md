# jumble
Get a suggestion from (or add to) your own personal ever growing list of movies when you're stuck for a suggestion. A Paradox of Choice device, 
greatly reducing the need for executive processing when stuck in the mud.

Apply to any decision! Maybe

Run using:
cd to project directory
python jumble.py
